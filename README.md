The project connects to a mock database. That database file can be found [here](https://github.com/Yanky597/Mock-Ecommerce-Application/blob/master/EcommerceDatabase.bacpac).
If you would like to see how I generated the mock data. Please checkout my project [Mock-Data-Generator](https://github.com/Yanky597/Mock-Data-Generator).
